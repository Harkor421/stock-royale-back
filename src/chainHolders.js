// ============================================================================
// chainHolders.js — holder detection with no indexer at all.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Robinhood Chain's public Blockscout sits behind a Cloudflare
// challenge and answers a server 403 with an HTML "Just a moment…" page; the
// Pro API answers 402 without a paid key. So the usual approach — crawl the
// explorer's /holders endpoint — fails, and it fails *quietly*, looking exactly
// like a token with no holders. That has cost real debugging time.
//
// This reads the chain instead. Every ERC-20 balance is the sum of its Transfer
// events, so replaying those logs reconstructs the holder set exactly, from
// ground truth, with no third party in the path and no API key.
//
//   1. walk BACKWARDS from the head until the token goes quiet — that is where
//      its history starts
//   2. replay Transfer logs forward from there, adaptive range sizing
//   3. keep the balances and a cursor, so later polls only scan new blocks
//
// It is slower to start than an indexer and then cheaper than one forever.
//
// NOTE ON THIS RPC. The public node is NOT an archive node: historical STATE is
// pruned after roughly ten minutes of blocks, so eth_getCode at an old block
// errors out and the deployment block cannot be binary-searched. Historical
// LOGS are still served, which is why this works at all — and why the start of
// history is found by looking for silence rather than for code.
